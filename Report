Project: Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Role: Developed a machine learning model to predict daily stock closing prices using historical trading data.

Key Outcomes:

Achieved 98.6% correlation between predicted and actual prices and an RÂ² score of 0.97, demonstrating strong model fit.

Implemented feature engineering using Open, High, Low, and Previous Close values as inputs.

Performed data preprocessing and scaling with StandardScaler to improve model accuracy.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE (7.68) and MAE (1.94).

Generated plots to compare actual vs. predicted values and analyze trends visually.

Also visualizations have been made on unseen data where ground truth is not known to compare actual and predicted prices for Opening stock prices judging 
how well the model generalizes (or fits) itself to unseen data by hyperparameter tuning of X_train.
